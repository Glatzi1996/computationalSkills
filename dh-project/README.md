## Information (u:find)
### Aims, contents and method of the course
This course is intended to provide basic training and support for further skills courses in the Digital Humanities. It is strongly recommended as a prerequisite to the other DH practical courses.
As such, students will be required to bring a laptop computer (no tablets!) If this presents a problem, please contact one of the course instructors in advance.
- Introduction to the command line
- Introduction to file formats and filesystems
- Solving the mystery of special characters
- Understanding how the Internet works behind the browser
- Things you ought to know about your (Mac / Windows / Linux) operating system
- Where to go for help and how to understand the answers

### Assessment and permitted materials
Assessment will be on the basis of class participation, 'question' points, and intermittent quizzes.

## Exercise Guided Lecture Goals
We will try to accompany the contents of each course with some practical steps of the exercise, which will lead to a final project in the end.

The exercise goals of each lecture are:
- Day 1:
  - Install needed software to be used as terminal and code editor
  - Get familiar using the shell and code editor
  - Change to your desktop directory and create a folder with empty README.md and index.html files for the project
- Day 2:
  - Apply learned RegEx methods to create the .csv file which will be used in the project
- Day 3:
  - Download the exercise/lecture3/data.csv file and inspect it using the code editor
  - Make basic modifications the index.html and README.md files following the boilerplate code found in exercise/lecture3 folder
  - Create an empty repository on Github wit MIT Licence and push your project folder to remote (project folder should contain index.html, data.csv, README.md and LICENCE files)
- Day 4:
  - Modify the JavaScript function given in the boilerplate code to execute various regex tasks
  - See the output of regex by opening the index.html file with a browser
  - Understand how our code fetches the data using HTTP requests
  - Create HTML elements such as tables, divs, paragraphs etc. for our output
  - Add basic CSS styles for different elements
- Day 5:
  - Add basic interaction elements e.g. buttons in HTML
  - Bind the elements to our JavaScript functions to toggle the data being displayed
  - Finalize the project, push it to git repo and make it online using GitHub Pages
